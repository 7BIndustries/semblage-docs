# Community

This page is dedicated to resources for the community that will hopefully form around Semblage if it proves useful.

## Communication Channels

* [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/semblage) - Traditional mailing list. Messages from new users must be approved twice before your messages will come through automatically.

## Contributing

There is a contribution guide in the Semblage GitHub repository. [Link](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Translating

The Godot game engine supports translations, as does mkdocs, which is used to build the documentation. Translations are welcome and desired, but more work needs to be done to add the infrastructure to support them. If you are interested in doing translations, please open a GitHub issue or start a conversation on the community channels.

## Accessibility

Ideally, Semblage would be usable to the largest range of people possible. The accessibility support in Semblage is non-existent at this point, but there is a desire to improve this situation in the future. If you are someone who has an interest in accessibility, please start a conversation on the community channels or in a GitHub issues.

For reference, there is an accessibility plugin for the Godot game engine [here](https://github.com/lightsoutgames/godot-accessibility). That may be a starting point for Semblage's accessibility support in the future.
