# Community

This page is dedicated to resources for the community that will form around Semblage if it proves useful.

## Communication Channels

* [Groups.io](https://groups.io/g/semblage) - Traditional mailing list. Messages from new users must be approved twice before your messages will come through automatically.

## Contributing

There is a [contribution guide](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the Semblage GitHub repository. There is also a [separate developer setup guide](developer_setup.md) on setting up a development environment for Semblage. There is also a [codebase tour](codebase_tour.md) to help new developers get their bearings. If you are interested in contributing code, please introduce yourself on the issue tracker or in one of the communication channels. Semblage has essentially two layers, the Godot layer and the Python layer. Depending on where your expertise and interest lies, here are two resources to get started learning how each layer works.

* [Godot Game Engine Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)
* [Godot Python Plugin](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python)

## Translating

The Godot game engine supports translations, as does mkdocs, which is used to build this documentation. Translations are welcome and desired, and information about adding translations for additional languages to Semblage is covered in the link below. More work needs to be done to add the mkdocs mechanism to support translations, and a link for that process will be added in the future.

If you are interested in doing translations, please open a GitHub issue or start a conversation on the community channels.

* [Translating The Semblage User Interface](ui_translation.md)

## Accessibility

One goal of Semblage is to be usable to the largest range of people possible. The accessibility support in Semblage is non-existent at this point, but there is a desire to improve this situation in the future. If you are someone who has a background and interest in accessibility, please start a conversation on the community channels or in a GitHub issue.

For reference, there is an accessibility plugin for the Godot game engine [here](https://github.com/lightsoutgames/godot-accessibility). That may be a starting point for Semblage's accessibility support in the future.
