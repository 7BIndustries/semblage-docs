# Installation

***NOTE*** Only 64-bit AMD and Intel systems are supported at this time. ARM, as well as AMD and Intel 32-bit support, is not officially available.

There is no installer for Semblage, it is distributed as a zip file that can be extracted and used as-is. The following steps should be followed to get to a point where Semblage can be launched.

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/releases).
2. Click on the latest release, and download the zip file for your operating system.
3. Once the download is complete, extract the archive into an easy-to-access location.
4. Run the `Semblage` binary in the root directory.
5. The Semblage GUI should launch.

If there are problems, please file an [issue](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/issues) or post a message on the [community channels](community.md#communication-channels). Launching Semblage from the command line on your platform is a good way to collect debugging information when asking for help.

Once Semblage is up an running, you can proceed to the [Usage](usage.md) documentation.
