# Semblage Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Semblage, a community-based, open source 2D/3D CAD application that seeks to blend the mouse-driven and programmatic CAD worlds. If you are brand new to Semblage, it is recommended that you read the [introduction page](introduction.md) to get an overview of what Semblage is before moving on to the [Installation]intallation.md) and [Usage](usage.md) documentation.

If you get stuck at any point while going through this documentation, you can ask questions on any of the [communication channels](community.md#communication-channels).

***PLEASE NOTE:*** Semblage is in alpha, and so significant bugs may be present. Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/7BIndustries/Semblage/issues) or post a message on the [community channels](community.md#communication-channels) if you encounter a bug.
