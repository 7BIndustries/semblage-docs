# Developer Setup - General

## Introduction

Semblage is built using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) (using GDScript), and a plugin for Godot called [Godot Python](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python). Both of these need to be installed, along with a set of dependencies, for Semblage to work properly. This guide will walk developers through that process for their preferred operating system. Each operating system (Linux and Windows) have their own documents, with links below.

* [Linux](developer_setup_linux.md)
* [Windows](developer_setup_windows.md)

MacOS support has been dropped due to signing requirements requiring a paid developer account, but the instructions still exist and the link is below. If you are a MacOS developer with a paid developer account who is willing to help out with this, please let us know in the communication channels.

* [MacOS](developer_setup_macos.md)

The original monolithic developer setup documentation can be found [here](developer_setup_old.md), but is outdated now.
