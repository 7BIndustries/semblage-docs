# Developer Setup - General

## Introduction

Semblage is built using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) (using GDScript), and a plugin for Godot called [Godot Python](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python). Both of these need to be installed, along with a set of dependencies, for Semblage to work properly. This guide will walk developers through that process for their preferred operating system. Each operating system (Linux, Windows, MacOS) have their own documents, with links below.

* [Linux](#) (developer_setup_linux.md)
* [Windows](developer_setup_windows.md)
* [MacOS](#) (TBA)

The original monolithic developer setup documentation can be found [here](developer_setup_old.md).
